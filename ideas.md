I want a progessive web app. It needs to be statically hosted, so that it doesn't need any backend. 
It needs 3 input fields:
	1. current_stitches 
	2. total_needed_stiches
	3. increase
input bumber 1 is mandatory, the user must input either 2 or 3 and the program will calculate the one of the two the user dint input, based on input 1 and 2 or 3. 
The formula for this calculation is total_needed_stitches = current_stitches + increase

1 increase is adding 1 stitch. the app should tell the user how many stitches the user shoul knit between each increase, to make the amount of stitches between each increase as even as possible. It is better to have varying amount of stiches between each increase, but this difference should be as small as possible.
